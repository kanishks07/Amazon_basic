📊 Amazon Sales Data Analysis using SQL

This project focuses on analyzing Amazon-style e-commerce sales data using SQL to extract meaningful business insights. The goal is to practice writing real-world SQL queries that help answer common product, pricing, and customer review questions that an e-commerce company would care about.

The dataset includes information about products, their actual and discounted prices, discount percentages, categories, ratings, and customer reviews.

🚀 Project Objectives

In this project, I worked on queries that help answer questions such as:

Finding products based on price ranges and discounts

Identifying highly discounted products

Searching products by name or category

Comparing actual prices vs discounted prices

Analyzing customer reviews based on keywords

Filtering products based on ratings and pricing patterns

The focus is on writing clean, efficient SQL queries that can be used for business analysis and decision-making.
